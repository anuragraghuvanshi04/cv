    <li><strong><a href="https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=13009">Characterization of Airborne Antenna Group Delay Biases as a Function of Arrival Angle for Aircraft Precision Approach Operations</a>, ION GNSS+2015, Tampa, FL September 2015</strong>, <em>Authors: Anurag Raghuvanshi, Frank van Graas</em> – Antenna induced group delay is a major error source to consider for achieving accuracy, availability and integrity for the Category III landing using single frequency Ground Based Augmentation System. The paper characterized the antenna group delay variations for a single frequency antenna as a function of azimuth and elevation angles.</li>
    <li><strong> <a href="https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=13624">Impact of Antenna Group Delay Variations on Protection Levels</a>, ION/IEEE PLANS, Savannah, GA April 2016</strong>, <em>Authors: Anurag Raghuvanshi, Frank van Graas</em>. The paper studied the impact of the antenna group delay variations on the vertical protection levels. </li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=14878">Bounding GPS L1 Antenna Group Delay Variation for GNSS Landing System Integrity</a>, ITM 2017</strong>, <em>Authors: Matt Harris, Matt Miltner, Tim Murphy (Boeing Commercial Airplanes), Anurag Raghuvanshi, Frank van Graas (Ohio University)</em>. The paper “Characterization of Airborne Antenna Group Delay Biases as a Function of Arrival Angle for Aircraft Precision Approach Operations” proved that it was difficult to separate the airborne multipath and antenna group delay variation measurements in flight. Thus, a combined model of the residual airborne multipath and antenna group delay variations was presented in this paper. Flight test data from Boeing was used for the analysis.
      The existing model for the standard deviation of the airborne multipath and noise was found sufficient to include the antenna group delay variations too. </li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.ion.org/publications/abstract.cfm?articleID=15561">The Effect of Aircraft Antenna Group Delay Variations on Dual Solution Ionospheric Gradient Monitoring</a>, ITM 2018</strong>, <em>Authors: Anurag Raghuvanshi, Frank van Graas (Ohio University)</em>. A Dual Solution Ionospheric Gradient monitor is used to detect anomalous ionospheric behavior. The impact of the antenna group delay variation on the monitor threshold was studied.</li>
